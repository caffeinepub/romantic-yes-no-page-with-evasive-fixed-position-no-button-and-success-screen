  "summary": "Core UI/screens and evasive fixed-position behavior are largely implemented (question screen, success screen with heart animation, fixed 'No' button that repositions on mouseenter/touch/click). However, the main-screen layout requirement about having two buttons beneath the heading is not met due to the 'No' button being rendered separately as a fixed element away from the button row. The diff also introduces unrequested Internet Identity/react-query actor plumbing and touches immutable paths per constraints.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Create a main screen with a centered heading and two buttons beneath it.",
      "reason": "The 'No 💔' button is rendered as a fixed-position element outside the centered button row, and the button row under the heading only contains the 'Yes 💖' button—so the two buttons are not presented beneath the heading together.",

        "frontend/src/screens/QuestionScreen.tsx"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Mobile interaction: tapping 'No 💔' must move it to a new random fixed position and must never remain in the same place after a tap.",
      "reason": "The reposition logic compares against `previousPosition` (which is set to the prior `position` after computing the new one), meaning the distance check can be against an older position rather than the immediately previous one. Also, when maxAttempts is reached it may accept an insufficiently different position, so it does not strictly guarantee a different position after every tap.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Internet Identity authentication/provider wiring added to app bootstrapping.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly lists Internet Identity authentication as a non-goal and also marks `frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.ts(x)` and `frontend/src/main.tsx` as immutable paths; nevertheless the diff includes these pieces.",

    },
    {
      "description": "Backend Motoko actor file added as an empty actor with no functionality.",
